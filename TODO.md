# Known issues

If you modify a browser flow and add the webauthn-passwordless step as
an alternative to the user/password-form, you will see a button which brings you
to a second dialog box. Unfortunately the locales are broken here, so you
will see nauthilus-authenticator-display-name and nauthilus-authenticator-help-text.
